56,Why is my mouse acting erratically?,Users who have an optical mechanical mouse (most common mouse for desktop computers) are likely experiencing erratic behaviour because the mouse is not clean or is dirty. If you've cleaned the mouse and continue to encounter issues and this mouse has worked in the past fine unfortunately your mouse is likely defective. One additional test that can be done to help determine if this is the case or not is to connect the mouse to another computer. Otherwise we suggest replacing the mouse.,Information Systems and Technology Center (ISTC); Question
57,"What should I do if my PC responds erratically, is sluggish or freezes up?","Most of the time this is happening due to a lack of available computer resources, such as RAM (random access memory). Occasionally, programs will consume a lot of RAM when they are opened and won't free up that memory for the operating system (i.e., Windows XP, Vista, Linux...) when the program is closed.
First, try closing all applications that you can do without. If this does not remedy the problem, restarting the computer will release back the resources. If the start button is still responding, select Start/Shut Down, then Restart. If the Start button isn't responding, simultaneously press the Ctrl, Alt & Del keys, then select Restart.
If all else fails, push and hold the power button for a slow 10 second count. You will see the computer power down.

78,Should I leave the computer on or turn it off?,"Turn it off when not in use! You turn your TV, radio, and other devices off, so shut that computer down, too. There are always two sides to this issue and we believe the reasons to shut it off outweigh the reasons to leave it on, including leaving your system in ""sleep"" or ""standby"" mode.
Another reason you should shut your system down is memory leakage. When you run a program it grabs a chunk of memory to use and it is suppose to free up the memory when you close it, but sometimes it doesn't release all the memory and it becomes unavailable for other programs to use. When this happens your resources may become low and your computer sluggish. Re-starting the unit will solve this problem. When you just place your system in ""suspend"" mode it won't refresh your memory.
When you get an error message or other computer problem, the first thing you need to ask yourself is, what have you changed or installed. If you turn your computer off every day you only have to remember the last 24 hours but if you keep your system on and the error occurs after a reboot you have to remember everything that you did since the last time you rebooting your system which could be days, weeks or even months!

79,"What does it mean when my wireless adapter tells me I have ""Limited or No Connectivity?""",This means that your computer failed to receive an IP address from the server.,Information Systems and Technology Center (ISTC); Question
80,Why does my wireless card disconnect frequently?,"Most of the time, this is caused by a low signal strength from the wireless access points. Some adapters will be able to pick up on weaker signals, while others will drop the connection sporadically. If you are using an adapter that works solely on the 2.4 GHz frequencies (such as B and G cards), then try not to operate electronics that also work on the frequency (such as 2.4 GHz phones and microwaves) in the vicinity.
Some wireless adapters, however, do have driver issues that may cause them to sporadically break their connection. To avoid this issue, always make sure that you are running the proper drivers from the manufacturer’s Web site.",Information Systems and Technology Center (ISTC); Question

· Don't hint at the format of a password (e.g., ""my family name"").
· Don't reveal a password on questionnaires or security forms.
· Don't share a password with family members.
· Don't reveal a password to co-workers while on vacation.
· Don’t use the ""Remember Password"" feature of applications.
· Don’t use the same password on several computers and/or services as once revealed, it would compromise the security within all the others in one go.
· Do not write passwords on a piece of paper.
· Choose passwords that have a combination of upper case, lower case and numbers.
· If you choose good passwords and keep them confidential your password will remain secure.",Information Systems and Technology Center (ISTC); Question
82,Is it safe to turn off a Windows computer without doing a shut down?,Users should not simply press the power button or restart the computer while Windows is still running unless there is an issue with the computer.

84,How can I recover a file from the recycle bin?,"Double click the recycle bin icon on your desktop, here you will see all of the files within your bin. Select the files you wish to recover, right click and choose restore.",Information Systems and Technology Center (ISTC); Question
85,What are the best practices in remembering multiple passwords?,"A big problem with passwords is making them ""strong"" yet memorable. A strong password is one that is hard to guess (e.g. not a dictionary word or a number), is ""complex"" by using letters, numbers and special characters, and is long to defeat brute-force attacks (where every combination of letters and numbers is tried). Users want something memorable, not something cryptic and hard to remember.
People's natural tendency is to use a word that they will remember, like a pet's name or their favourite meal. These are often proper words that are found in a dictionary and are considered weak passwords because they are easily guessed by someone who knows you.
It is recommended that instead of picking a password, pick a passPHRASE. For instance, you could use the phrase ""Winner winner, chicken dinner!"" It's easy to remember, yet is long enough and has enough special characters to make a complex password. Passphrases can be based on anything, a favourite line from a movie, or a nursery rhyme for example.
You should also use substitutions to strengthen passphrases.
If you wanted a very strong passphrase for your most important accounts, you would want to make sure any dictionary words are changed using character substitution. Take the passphrase ""Winner winner, chicken dinner!"" again for example.
You could eliminate the dictionary words by replacing one of the 'n's by a capital 'N', or replacing the consecutive nn's by the lookalike 'm': ""WinNer wimer, chickeN dimer!"" Another frequent substitution is to replace the 'i' by '1' or 'l', resulting in ""W1nNer wimer, ch1cken dimer!""
For a long passphrase, you could just make an acronym from it. Take the phrase ""If not for bad luck, I would have no luck at all."" By taking the first letter of each word and the punctuation in the phrase, you can create a password: ""Infbl,Iwhnlaa."" That's a pretty strong password, yet it's still very easy to remember.
If you use the same kind of substitutions all the time, then you begin to remember the substitutions, so each time you change a password, all you need to do is remember the phrase and apply the substitutions.
Use a common root to help retention.
Passphrases are very useful for creating strong passwords. However, even with all the great phrases available to us, you may begin to run out of memorable ones. Another approach is to use a common root for the password a few times to extend the lifetime of the passphrase. You can either change the substitutions or add some new elements.
For instance, using ""Winner winner... "" again, if you previously changed the 'i' into a '1', perhaps this time you can choose to flip letters over, making 'w' into 'm' and 'n' into 'u', giving you ""Miuuer miuuer..."" You could change the menu, and have ""Winner winner, eggplant dinner!"" Some people like to include the date, so that all they have to do is remember the root and the date they last changed their password: ""Win20ner win09ner, chick09en din25ner!"" if they changed their password Sept 25, 2009.
Combining the passphrase, substitution and common root approaches can help you to make strong, memorable passwords that have an extended lifetime, simplifying your password management task and increasing the security of your accounts.",Information Systems and Technology Center (ISTC); Question
86,I am unable to send or receive email?,"Verify that your computer is able to see the Internet and/or other computers to ensure that your computer is not encountering a connection issue, which would be causing your e-mail issue.

87,What is Windows Remote Assistance?,"Sometimes clients and the HelpDesk can work more efficiently when they are both looking at the same screen. This is easy when your computer is at the Service Counter, but when people are working in their office over the phone, communication can be more difficult. That is why using Remote Assistance can be a great help to both you and to the HelpDesk. The nice thing about Remote Assistance is this feature is already installed on all computers running Windows XP, and ready to use. It is also secure, because no one can connect to your PC without you giving them permission
After receiving a request for Remote Assistance, the HelpDesk consultant can remotely connect to your PC and view the screen directly to fix the problem.

88,I cannot receive any email attachments?,"If the e-mail box is full of other e-mail messages and/or your storage space is only a few megabytes it's possible that the attachment being sent cannot be received. Often if this problem is occurring the person sending the e-mail should get a response back from your e-mail server indicating that your mailbox is full and/or has exceeded its allocated size. Because computer viruses and other malware are best distributed through e-mail, many e-mail service providers, companies, and e-mail programs prevent certain types of file extensions from being distributed or received through e-mail. For example, Microsoft Outlook protect its users by automatically disabling certain file extension types from being received in e-mail.",Information Systems and Technology Center (ISTC); Question

133,What will the relation between Company and GJU look like on working level?,"-As one of the main challenges in the set-up of Dual Study programs is the matching of the content of vocational training and academic training, partners have to join forces and collaborate to their best possibilities to achieve this goal.
-As the academic content has to be adapted regularly to the changing necessities of the companies (curricula revision), company representatives are asked to engage in related discussions and meetings, to which they are frequently invited.
-Partners have to secure that training activities do not overlap and that contact persons can be reached at times comfortable to the students.
-The cooperation between GJU and the companies is reflected in the active cooperation of both sides, also in joint committees.
-It is important that companies and universities maintain close personal contacts and have regular meetings for discussion and exchange on both program and management level. Fixed contact points are needed, low turnover of staff is desirable to avoid loss of knowledge.
-Partners should convene regularly on high level to discuss progress and challenges. These meetings should deliver proposals for decisions, and may include other stakeholders.
-The university ensures the academic capabilities of the students. The scientific level of a Dual Bachelor's degree program is comparable to the standards of a normal bachelor's degree course in the same field. Both degrees allow access to master-level studies.
-It should be agreed between companies and GJU, which topics students may deal with in their projects and what students have to deliver in their bachelor thesis.",Dual Studies (DS); Answer
134,Which are the added values GJU’s Dual Study programs offer?,"Cooperation with GJU in a Dual Study programs pays off in many respects:

-Well-established, intensified contacts to institutions conduction applied research
-Access to innovation
-Solutions to actual challenges the Company faces (Dual Study programs include study projects, in which students work independently, though supported by supervisors from the University and from the Company, on a specific question or problem which was defined by the company, presenting a solution or a scenario as a result.)
-Through GJUs intensive collaboration to more than 110 partner universities and a similar number of partner companies in Germany:
i. New contacts to German companies through the internship abroad included in the Dual program
ii. Fresh ideas and business opportunities with German companies
e) Recruitment of tailor-made graduates with well-developed competences:
i. Well-acquainted with the Company’s structures and processes from day one of employment
ii. Solid emotional ties to the Company
iii. Knowledge about workflows and processes in German internship partner companies
iv. Thinking in other, new structures
v. Intercultural knowledge, tested in real life
vi. Fluency in German and English as foreign languages
vii. Strong soft skills
viii. Personality development in an international context
ix. Direct influence on the development of the Dual curricula (also on the academic parts)
x. No costly past-graduate training / upgrading of Dual employees

Especially for SMEs, which often cannot afford to hire specialists, it should be attractive to recruit Dual graduates, as they have more generalist skills.",Dual Studies (DS); Answer
135,What is the difference to just adding more internships?,"In Dual Study Programs, the academic curriculum and the training at the company are closely connected. Students are continuously integrated in the company‘s workflow, so that they become well acquainted with processes and structures and are immediately fit to start work after graduation. Many of them are directly hired by “their” company, and the others are much demanded by other employers.

In Germany, Dual Study Programs exists since many years and have proven to be effective in providing companies with ""tailor made"" new staff and to bring graduates directly into employment, but also to enhance industry-university cooperation.",Dual Studies (DS); Answer
136,Why should we introduce Dual Study Programs in Jordan and at GJU?,"Highly qualified “brains” are Jordan’s most important resource, but their education has to fit with the needs of the Jordanian economy.

Many companies have voiced a need for more staff able to apply theoretical knowledge for managing and problem solving in the real world. They also argue that graduates should be better trained in soft skills like project management, negotiation skills, teamwork in applied and international contexts etc. Such soft skills are trained best in real life situations, i.e. in the companies and not just in the classroom.

GJU as a University following the Applied Sciences model has excellent prerequisites to carry out such an ambitious project successfully: Well established contacts to Jordanian firms (its proximity to industry, called the ""Industrial Dimension""), an innovative and entrepreneurial spirit, a proactive management and motivated academic staff on the one hand, and pronounced links to Germany on various levels and its numerous partner universities and companies in Germany (called the ""German Dimension"") on the other. It wants to further intensify its cooperation with industry, to foster innovation, increase productivity, and reduce youth unemployment. This cooperation also serves to develop new and innovative curricula, as companies are invited to participate in curriculum development and bring in their needs and perspectives. That takes place especially (but not only) in Dual Study Programs, which can only work if university and industry are working closely together.

In brief, the establishment of Dual Study Programs creates a win-win situation for companies, the GJU and students.",Dual Studies (DS); Answer
137,What will Dual Study Programs at GJU look like?,"With the establishment of Dual Study programs, Higher Education in Jordan will enter new territory. Due to the different economic and cultural situation, the introduction of Dual Study programs must take place in an adapted form. Selected partner companies and important other stakeholders were invited to join reflections about the best way to set up Dual Study programs at GJU.

Based on the findings of the related workshops and discussions, the GJU Dual Studies team is currently developing compatible and feasible proposals. It was decided to set up of dual study options (“tracks”) within existing BA courses of GJU. 

BA programs will be enriched with intensive practical phases in selected partner companies. Students will study at GJU and work at a company in intervals throughout the entire duration of the program. They will also go to Germany to spend a semester at a partner university and to do an internship at a German company.

Dual Studies @ GJU will be more than just another internship – students are supposed to take over serious tasks in the companies, bring the knowledge gained at GJU to their workplace at the company and include current challenges and research interests identified in the companies to GJU, through projects, thesis work etc.",Dual Studies (DS); Answer
138,How to decide about joining a Dual Study program of GJU?,"-Clarify your recruiting demands – which and how many highly qualified employees will you need in the coming five to ten years?
-Do you have the means to develop a concise training plan for the Dual Student(s)? This can be done in cooperation with GJU staff and external experts, but certain prerequisites must be met by your company.
-Do you have the time and staff to get involved in related committees / Boards to develop and influence the shape of the Dual program and its content?
-Are you ready to engage in a long-term partnership, with GJU as well as with one or several students, both manifested through a Company-University and a Company Student contract to define the relation (“rights and duties”) between the partners?

-There must be a company training plan (can eventually be developed with support by GJU), which presents the training content in the enterprise, in terms of time and materials / resources, and relates to the academic content.
The company has to provide a qualified supervisor / mentor for each accepted student. In addition, it has to nominate a person (Liaison Officer) in charge of maintaining continuous contact with a respective counterpart at GJU.
-The Company has to sign a “Company-University Contract on collaboration in the Dual Study program”. This contract includes duties, rights, timelines and dates of all partners. It should be as much uniform as possible for all, but leave room for flexibility, as participating companies have different needs and strategies. The Company-University Contract ensures that the students can complete their studies even if unexpected changes in -the cooperation between the company and university arise.",Dual Studies (DS); Answer
140,What are the requirements that applicants (trainee students) must meet in order to be accepted into the Dual bachelor's program?,"Applicants must meet the minimum academic requirements determined by the relevant school. Students are required to have a partner company.

142,What’s the nature of the training the company has to offer?,"-The professional scope of the training in the companies should not aim exclusively at a specific activity in the sponsoring company, but should prepare for various possible fields of employment.
-The qualification objectives of the Dual programs are clearly presented in the outline of the program and in the curriculum. They must be agreed between all cooperation partners directly involved in the implementation of the Dual program.",Dual Studies (DS); Answer
143,What are the timelines that apply to the selection of trainee students for the Dual Studies program?,"Candidates are selected through a collaborative process between GJU and partner companies.

First, the German Jordanian University evaluates the student's application for the Dual Studies program. If admission requirements are met and the student is accepted at GJU, the application documents are sent to three companies that the student has previously identified as preferred options for their practical phases.

Second, the university organizes a Company Day, providing partner companies with an opportunity to introduce themselves to the students.

Third, each company reviews the incoming applications and internally ranks the candidates. The company may use interviews or other assessment methods to make their selections. Through this process, the company provides a list to the Dual Studies coordinator of the students they intend to accept for their practical training phases.

Fourth, the Dual Studies coordinator formulates an employment plan for the students and companies. In case of any mismatches, a joint alignment meeting will be held.

Finally, the student and the company sign a contract, outlining their respective rights and responsibilities.",Dual Studies (DS); Answer
